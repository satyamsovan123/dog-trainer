    We all know how effortlessly simple it is to get a dog to sit, stay, or stop
    chewing on your favorite objects. And for those, who cannot control (unlike
    me, duh!), welcome to DogTrainer, where we train you to train your dog. Our
    app promises to makes your pet paw-fect, an obedient companion without any
    effort on your part (excluding brain?). With just a few taps on your screen,
    you'll witness your furry friend turning into a model dog, following your
    every command. After all, who needs years of experience or a deep
    understanding of doggie behavior when you've got a free app, right?
